A queue is a useful data structure in programming. It is similar to the ticket queue outside a cinema hall, where the first person entering the queue is the first person who gets the ticket.

You can see a simple example in `example1.cpp` where a basic queue is created.

And, in the second example `example2.cpp`, is an example of how a queue is applied in a simulation of a row of some market.
