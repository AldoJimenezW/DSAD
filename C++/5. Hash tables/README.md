# **Hash tables**

Hashing is a technique that is used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects. Some examples of how hashing is used in our lives include:

- In universities, each student is assigned a unique roll number that can be used to retrieve information about them.
- In libraries, each book is assigned a unique number that can be used to determine information about the book, such as its exact position in the library or the users it has been issued to etc.

In both these examples the students and books were hashed to a unique number.
