# 1. Arrays

An array is a sequential list of values. You can use arrays to store and access multiple values of the same data type under one identifier. Arrays makes it easier to perform operations on an entire dataset. Theyâ€™re also great for retrieving data.

There are one-dimensional arrays and multi-dimensional arrays. The values stored in an array are called elements. Elements are stored in consecutive blocks of memory called indexes. The size of an array is determined by the number of elements it contains. Pictured is a one-dimensional array with a size of six.

In `example1.cpp` you can see a simple example where an array of length 10 is defined with its respective elements of type int, then each of them is traversed by a for loop that allows us to print each of them on the screen.

In addition, in `example2.cpp` we can see functions that we can make with arrays.

Now, another structure similar to Array is Vector, this is a sequential container. Vector is not index based. Array is a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. In fact, array is index based.

Vectors are the dynamic arrays that are used to store data.It is different from arrays which store sequential data and are static in nature, Vectors provide more flexibility to the program. Vectors can adjust their size automatically when an element is inserted or deleted from it.

In `example3.cpp` we can see an example of a vector, where you can see some functions that we can apply to this structure.
