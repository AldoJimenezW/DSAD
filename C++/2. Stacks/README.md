# **2. Stacks**

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO). This means the last element inserted inside the stack is removed first.

You can think of the stack data structure as the pile of plates on top of another.

You can see a simple example in `example1.cpp` where a basic stack is created.

And, in the second example `example2.cpp`, we can see stacks with some methods applied.
